    <h2>About Johannesburg</h2>
    <p>Johannesburg (Zulu and Xhosa: eGoli), informally known as Jozi, Joburg or "the city of gold",is the largest city in South Africa and one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.It is the provincial capital and largest city of Gauteng, which is the wealthiest province in South Africa.Johannesburg is the seat of the Constitutional Court. The city is located in the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills and is the centre of large-scale gold and diamond trade. It was one of the host cities of the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. 
    . In 2019, the population of the city of Johannesburg was 5,635,127, making it the most populous city in South Africa.In the same year, the population of Johannesburg's urban agglomeration was put at 8,000,000.[6] land area of the municipal city (1,645 km2 or 635 sq mi) is large in comparison with those of other major cities, resulting in a moderate population density of 2,364 per square kilometre. 
    The city was established in 1886 following the discovery of gold on what had been a farm. Due to the extremely large gold deposit found along the Witwatersrand,within ten years, the population had grown to 100,000 inhabitants. 
    A separate city from the late 1970s until 1994, Soweto is now part of Johannesburg. Originally an acronym for "South-Western Townships", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for Blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of Indian descent. These areas were designated as non-white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the South African government known as Apartheid.</p>
